# Intangible-coin

## Intangible coin is a project meant to make the intangible things in our relationships, connections, and interactions a litte more tangible. Users can create an account and send or recieve coins along with optional feedback. Once a user registers their account, their initial Intangible coin balance will be based on how many hours they have lived from their date of birth to the moment their account is registered. Users will also automatically accrue one coin every hour for the rest of their lives. Users can also have a list of contacts, and their transaction history will be saved to their accounts. This project is not complete yet, and this code is only the backend API. The front end will be constructed soon with react. The version of this project currently being built is the alpha stage.
