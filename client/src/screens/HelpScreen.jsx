      <h2>FAQ</h2>
      <p>Q. What is an example of Intangibles?</p>
      <p>A. Happiness is intangible. So are things like beauty, love, and quality; each being in the eye of the beholder (e.g. "I know it when I see it").</p>
      <p>Q. Does an Intangible Coin make intangibles more tangible?</p>
      <p>A. Yes. With Intangible Coins, a person's subjective experiences are being memorialized [with similar surety & incorruptibility of blockchain ledgering].</p>
      <p>Q. Why is this important or useful to me?</p>
      <p>A. A photograph, or other artifact, tangibly captures moments in time & nature. But these often do not do justice to the felt power of an event, especially when it comes to ongoing human interactions. In order to fully appreciate [or validate] time spent with other people [social connection nodes & dyads], it can be healthy to express [or rewarding to exchange] otherwise unspoken [residual] sentiments towards one another. And this applies to personal as well as professional contexts.</p>
      <p>Q. Does this mean Intangible Coin can help me improve my networks of relationships?</p>
      <p>A. Yes. By mapping the sources and targets of one's most enriching contacts - whether reciprocated or not - a user of Intangible Coin can more effectively manage their free-time.</p>
      <p>Q. What does my free-time have to do with Intangible Coins?</p>
      <p>A. Intangible Coin can tell you where and when [and optionally why & how] you are having a significant positive [or optionally negative] influence on other people. It can also empower you to avoid influence(r)s on you that are not especially gratifying or welcome.</p>
      <p>Q. Does Intangible Coin only focus on relationships?</p>
      <p>A. No. One's individual reputation is something that Intangible Coins can also help manage. By tracking information about how you are being perceived by others - in all walks of life - and comparing those impressions to how you would like to be seen, Intangible Coins can enable you to lead & enjoy a more fulfilling lifestyle.</p>
      <p>Q. How does this work?</p>
      <p>A. Intangible Coin is basically a platform on which you give and receive meaningful feedback, to and from other people [or optionally entities], safely and securely.</p>
      <p>Q. Is this similar to "reviews" of products & services I buy or sell?</p>
      <p>A. Yes. Except instead of satisfaction ratings involving money, an Intangible Coin is a unit [of currency] that measures your satisfaction with the time you spend on non-monetary-related tasks & activities.</p>
      <p>Q. I'm sold! What do I do next?</p>
      <p>A. To sign-up, simply register a new account, and begin playing with your beginning banked balance of Intangible Coins.</p>
      <p>Q. Huh? Where does any balance come from, if I've never registered an account before? </p>
      <p>A. After you register, Intangible Coins are earned in two ways: 1) +1 per hour of your life; and 2) by receiving them [+ or (optionally) -] from other people. Before you register, Intangible Coins are accumulated at the rate of 1 per week of your life. So your beginning balance reflects your exact age at the time you first register. As an example, if you just turned 40 on the day you register a new account, you will have lived 2,080 weeks, which translates to an opening balance of 2,080 Intangible Coins.</p>
      <p>Q. Why is age a factor in calculating Intangible Coins?</p>
      <p>A. Age is a universal concept that applies to everyone equally. Age also implies ever-increasing life experience, with an intangible component. Similarly, time is a construct that is both tangible [or linear/rational] and intangible [or circular/irrational]. Both forms of time are "real," and the Intangible Coin platform uses age as a way to distinguish the benefit of time pursuing intangible rewards [validation], from benefits associated with time pursuing tangible things [stuff].</p>
      <p>Q. Sounds pretty philosophical & technical, can you dumb this down for me?</p>
      <p>A. Sure - think of what the word "capital" means to you ... if you are imagining things like money, and all the things money can do, start comparing that to all the things important to you that money can't buy [often referred to as "priceless"]. Both tangibles and intangibles are [mutually-exclusive] forms of capital.</p>
      <p>Q. Ok. I'm trying to register for the first time, and being asked for proof of identity, including my date of birth. Is this really necessary?</p>
      <p>A. Yes. In order to assure the integrity for all users of the Intangible Coin platform [medium/means of exchange + store of value], every account-holder must be verified as unique [only one account per person].</p>
      <p>Q. What prevents me from creating more than one account, with a different email, phone number, and valid form of identification?</p>
      <p>A. Your birthdate and name will almost always be identical across all valid forms of identification.</p>
      <p>Q. I have successfully registered a new account. Now what?</p>
      <p>A. The first thing to do is create one or more contacts (under "Account" then "Contact List"). After you've created a contact, you can then "Send Coins" to that contact. On the main home page, you will see a list transactions (coins sent and received) below your running balance.</p>
      <p>Q. Is there anything else I should know?</p>
      <p>A. If you have additional questions not covered in this FAQ, please feel free to email support@intangible.zone [automatically sent to Robert & Pap√©].</p>
